Before coming to the game and character creation session, please make sure you do the following:

1. Read through the [Character](http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/character-creation) and [Game](http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/game-creation) Creation parts of the fate SRD
2. Think about who you want to play.  See below for details on your character
3. It's a good idea to have an idea for a name for your character, though it might change through the character creation process

## The Basics

The game will take place in modern day London, but this does not mean you need to play someone from London, or even from the UK.  Every player will be playing a ordinary, 20-something person living at this time in London.  You should think about who your character is in the normal world. What do they do? Are they in uni? Do they work at a local coffee shop, or as an apprentice to a haberdasher?

Even though your character will be ordinary, keep in mind, they should be exceptional at something.  So think about that background also.

## What they know

The world is at unrest.  Putin is being crazy in Russia, Trump is rabble rousing in the US, and the Middle East is seeing constant turmoil.  It's a pot of water threatening to boil over.  The U.K. might be the world's last hope to quench the fire, but the government is inactive and incapable of action.
