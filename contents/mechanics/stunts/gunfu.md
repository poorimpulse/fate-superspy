While everyone has some ability to shoot a gun, with gun-fu, you have taken the use of firearms to a new level.  This is a series of stunts that allow you to move and position yourself in a gun fight.

**The way**: The way allows you to anticipate the path of the bullet in close quarters, conveniently getting out of the way as the trigger is being pulled.  You can dodge bullets with an Athletics roll, but only when you are within the same zone as the attacker. 

**Your bullet is my bullet** (requires The Way): After a successful defensive Athletics roll, you gain a +1 on your next Shoot roll against that opponent as long as you do not use The Way again before the attack.  Other actions are fine to delay the Shoot roll

**Lean into it** (requires The Way): If an opponent has hit you with an attack action using the Shoot skill, and you have not acted in this exchange, you can move 1 zone closer to the opponent.  This can only be used once per exchange.

**Dance of the flame**: Using a Shoot overcome roll against an opponent allows you to disarm the opponent.  You must be in the same zone as the opponent.  You must be empty handed in order to perform this stunt.

**Taste your own medicine** (requires Dance of the flame): After a successful Shoot overcome roll using Dance of the flame, you can make an attack using their own weapon against them.  Make a Shoot Attack roll against the opponent.  You cannot invoke an aspect on yourself for this roll
